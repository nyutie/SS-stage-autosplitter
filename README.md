# SS-stage-autosplitter by nyutie

## Features:

- auto splits

- auto reset

- use game time

## What's it for:

Prettymuch any single workshop level. Works with single bonus levels as well.

## How to use:

You only need to create splits per stage. The autosplitter will split when the stage goes up by one.

To create splits for a level, create many empty splits, beat the level and delete the leftover splits. You can then name the splits whatever you want.

## Works with:

Currently only works only with steam patch 5.1 and 5.2. Works with any dx version.

Epic and older steam patches support coming soon... maybe.

If you'd be willing to let me borrow your gog account for adding gog support, please let me know in the official [Greylock Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tBEvADR3tS), or the official [SS/EPN Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/QaJJ9WBxGA).
